# Why choosing a framework?

Next.js is considered a **"Meta-Framework"** because it extends the functionality of React, offering a more structured and opinionated approach to web development. But why at the first place you should consider using a meta-framework? We will discuss.

> Wait What? Meta-Framework?
> In software development, a meta-framework is a framework that provides a higher level of abstraction and functionality over existing frameworks. It essentially acts as a framework of frameworks, offering a more structured and opinionated approach to building applications. Meta-frameworks typically combine the strengths of multiple frameworks and provide additional features, such as routing, data fetching, and server-side rendering, to make it easier and more efficient for developers to create complex and scalable applications.

## Framework vs library

> Library
> A library is a collection of reusable code that provides specific functionality. Libraries are typically used to solve specific problems or to perform specific tasks. In the case of React, a library like React.js provides the core functionality for building user interfaces (UIs). React.js provides components, which are reusable pieces of UI code, and a virtual DOM, which is an abstraction of the DOM that makes it easier to update the UI efficiently.

So, React.js is **a JavaScript library**. It is responsible for handling the rendering of UI components and the management of the state of those components.

> Framework
> A framework is a more opinionated piece of software that provides a structure and a set of conventions for building applications. Frameworks typically provide a lot of functionality out of the box, and they often dictate how applications are structured and how code is written. In the case of React, a framework like Next.js provides a lot of additional functionality on top of React. Next.js provides features like server-side rendering, static site generation, automatic code splitting, built-in routing, and data fetching.

And therefor, Next.js is a framework (meta-framework), that might solve some specific issues, make your code more clean by architecture and help you organize and develop your your project faster and easier.

## Consider Pros and Cons of using Frameworks

In some cases choosing a framework over library might help and it could also be a pain for you project.
If you use a framework you generally gain:

- Increased productivity: Frameworks can help developers to write code more quickly and efficiently by providing pre-written code and conventions.

- Improved code quality: Frameworks can help developers to write cleaner and more maintainable code by enforcing coding standards and providing tools for code analysis and refactoring.

- Reduced development costs: Frameworks can help to reduce development costs by shortening the development cycle and reducing the need for custom coding.

- Enhanced security: Frameworks can help to improve the security of applications by providing built-in security features and by making it easier to identify and fix security vulnerabilities.

- Scalability: Frameworks can help to make applications more scalable by providing features for handling increased traffic and data.

These seem practical in the long run, But there are always cons:

- Steep learning curve: Frameworks can have a steep learning curve, which can make it difficult for developers to get started.
  In case of Next.js it is not that much hard, it's actually really easy to start a project with it.

- Reduced flexibility: Frameworks can be less flexible than libraries, which can make it difficult to implement custom functionality.
  In case of Next.js you must consider you might have problems using packages that are not optimized for Next.js and implementing React.js and tools. You probably have to always search "adding X in **Next.js**".

- Vendor lock-in: Frameworks can make developers more dependent on the framework vendor, which can make it difficult to switch to a different framework in the future.
  Yes, that's right, For Next.js the best possible option for deploying you app would be Vercel, But it might not be always the best case and deploying your app to other platform might not be as easy and you might think.
  For example, [OpenNext](https://open-next.js.org/) is a serverless adapter that helps you deploying your Next.js app to any platform.
  It says:

  > While Vercel is great, it's not a good option if all your infrastructure is on AWS. Hosting it in your AWS account makes it easy to integrate with your backend. And it's a lot cheaper than Vercel.
  > Next.js, unlike Remix or Astro, doesn't have a way to self-host using serverless. You can run it as a Node application. This however doesn't work the same way as it does on Vercel.

- Bloated code: Frameworks can sometimes result in bloated code due to the inclusion of unnecessary features and dependencies.

- Version conflicts: Frameworks can sometimes experience version conflicts, which can cause problems when upgrading to a new version of the framework.

### When to pick React.js?

With all that has been said, you might think in most of the cases Next.js is superior, but consider the below opinions that comes from experience, for choosing React over Next.js.

1. **You need more control over your application architecture**: React is a library, which means it gives you more control over the structure and organization of your code. If you need to implement custom functionality or have specific requirements for how your application is built, React may be a better choice.

2. **You are building a simple SPA**: If you are building a simple single-page application (SPA) that does not require server-side rendering or static site generation, React may be sufficient for your needs. Next.js's additional features may not be necessary for a simpler project.
   For example, a web-based dashboard is probably goes better with pure React.js project, you probably do not need SSR, SSG or ISR. A simple routing system might be better for you in this case and the other features of Next.js might seems to be fancy in this case.

3. **You are comfortable managing the state of your application**: React's state management system is based on its own concepts and terminology. If you are comfortable with this approach and prefer to manage state yourself, React may be a better fit.

4. **You are not familiar with the Next.js ecosystem**: Next.js has its own ecosystem of tools and libraries, and learning it requires some familiarity with React concepts and conventions. If you are not yet comfortable with either of these, sticking with React might be a better option for now.

5. **You are migrating from an existing React codebase**: If you already have a large codebase built with React, transitioning to Next.js may involve more effort and require significant changes to your existing code. In such cases, sticking with React might be a more straightforward approach.

### When SEO matters, always go for Next.js!

Next.js is a great choice for an online store or a news website; anything that depends on search engines benefits from Next.js features.
For example, a website has multiple routes and urls that get indexed by search engines, as a rule you need your pages to have title, description and other meta tags. Handling these in a pure React app is difficult and often bad for SEO, because first your app gets rendered and after getting the bundle the title gets changed by JavaScript.
In the case of Next.js rendering the page comes from Node.js, that before loading your page adds the title and meta tags and hydrate it on the client-side.
It Also comes with Image and other beneficial components, they are help you to make the user experience better for the first time visiter user.
